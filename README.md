## My process
1. HTML 
- Created nested Semantic Components
- Top-Down approach where I focused on the parent components first and then the child components within them. 

2. CSS
- Utilized Sass preprocessor to create my CSS styles. 
- Translated the provided styles (font families and color pallette) over to my '.scss' file
- Utlized the sass command line tool to connect my '.scss' file to my '.css' file
- Followed the same Top-Down approach as with my HTML file. I focused on creating the styles for the bigger components, moving onto the child components once I liked the styling of the parent components
- My approach for the responsive design did not follow mobile-first approach, instead it was not until I completed the web version first that I moved onto the mobile approach. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS Preprocessor
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
